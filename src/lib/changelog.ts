/**
 * Site changelog — single source of truth for the version number and the

 *
 * HOW TO UPDATE (do this with EVERY user-visible change):
 *   1. Add a new entry at the TOP of the array.
 *   2. Bump the version: new feature → minor (1.1.0 → 1.2.0),
 *      fix/small tweak → patch (1.1.0 → 1.1.1), big rework → major.
 *   3. Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (deploy date).
 *
 * The newest entry's version is shown in the footer.
